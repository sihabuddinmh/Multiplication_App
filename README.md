Multiplication Application for Elementary School Students using C++
Welcome to Multiplication Practice Software. This program will help you practice multiplication by presenting you with randomly generated practice problems at different level of difficulty. The difficulty is determined by the number of digits in the multiplication. You can specify the initial number of digits. The program will also keep track of your progress. At the end of each session, you may choose to continue or not.
